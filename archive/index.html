      <p>
          I am a graduate of Carleton University's biology program, 
          I am currently enrolled in Algonquin College's computer programming. 
          One day I'd like to combine the two and get into bioinformatics.

          <li>I'm a big Magic: The Gathering commander player. I spend a lot of my time helping my friends with deckbuilding.</li>

          <li>I like exploring abandoned places, especially broken down bridges, old train tracks, and deserted houses. That last one might be illegal.</li>
